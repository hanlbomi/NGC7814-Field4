Calibrated photometry of point sources in the NGC 7814 halo (Field 4). 
DOLPHOT (Dolphin 2000, PASP, 112, 1383) was used to reduce images taken with ACS/WFC (PID = 10889) on board HST.
The photometric calibration involves manual aperture corrections (e.g., Jang et al. 2021, ApJ, 906, 125) and zero-points obtained from the STScI webtool (ZP_F814W = 25.504 and ZP_F606W = 26.393).
This catalog was used for Figure 2 of Dhawan et al. 2022, ApJ, ***, ***.
